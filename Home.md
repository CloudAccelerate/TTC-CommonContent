# Oracle Touch the Cloud Series 
Times are changing and things are getting simpler in the Cloud! At Oracle we have invested in delivering a plethora of new Cloud Services and we want to show you how simple – yet powerful they are. We specifically wanted to focus on low code, high productivity services that can be used in building enterprise grade solutions. We believe the best way to do this is to showcase a real world business solution comprised of these services. You will build the entire solution during the course of this workshop all in a stress-free fun environment. By the end of this workshop you would have created a complete microservice solution. This solution will comprise of a reactive UI with various microservices providing data and functionality. No expertise or experience required We will have experienced instructors guide you through the tool’s online screens and explain how each service works. There is no expertise required from your side, just bring a laptop with a modern web browser.
